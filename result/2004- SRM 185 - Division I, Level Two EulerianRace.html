The city of Konigsberg is famous for its bridges.  The Tour de Konigsberg
is an annual bicycle race over a route that crosses each bridge exactly once.  
You are responsible for planning the route for this year's race.
</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
A series of checkpoints numbered from 0 to N-1 have been set up around the city, with
exactly one bridge between each pair of neighboring checkpoints.
For example, here is a picture of the bridges and checkpoints from last year's race.
</p>
<pre xmlns="http://topcoder.com">

</pre>
(There has been substantial construction since last year, however, so the bridges and checkpoints for this year's race
may be completely different.)

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
The route for the race must begin and end at checkpoint 0, and must proceed across the bridges from checkpoint
to checkpoint, crossing each bridge exactly once.  If the checkpoints are placed poorly, it might not be possible
to come up with such a route, so the planner for the first Tour de Kongisberg, Leonhard Euler, was careful
to leave instructions for how to lay out the checkpoints to guarantee that a successful race route will be possible.
He decreed that the checkpoints should be placed with an even number of bridges (greater than zero) leaving each checkpoint,
and furthermore that every checkpoint must be reachable from checkpoint 0.  The checkpoints for this year's race
were placed with Euler's instructions in mind.  Now your task is to plan the race route.  Fortunately, Euler also
left notes telling you how.
</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
You begin by laying out a tentative route that begins and ends at checkpoint 0.  At every step
along the way, this initial route leaves the current checkpoint via the unused bridge that leads to the lowest
numbered checkpoint.  When the tentative route returns to checkpoint 0, it may or may not have used all the bridges.  If it has, you
are done.  Otherwise, you need to extend the route to use more bridges as follows.  
Beginning at checkpoint 0, you follow the tentative route until
you reach a checkpoint--call it checkpoint K--that has an unused bridge leading
out from it.  (Note that K could be 0.)  Lay out a new route by starting at checkpoint K and 
repeatedly taking the unused bridge that leads to the lowest numbered checkpoint until you return to checkpoint K.
Now splice this new route into the tentative route after the first occurrence of K.
Repeat this extension process on the new larger tentative route until all the bridges have been used.  Note that
you always restart the search for a checkpoint with an unused bridge back at the beginning of the tentative route; 
you do <i>not</i> continue from where you left off.
</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
For example, in last year's race, the initial tentative route travelled from checkpoint 0 to 1 to 3 to 2.
Marking the used bridges with x's we get
</p>
<pre xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
    0-x-x-x-1
    |       |
    x       x
    |       |
    2-x-x-x-3
    |\     /|
    | \   / |
    |  \ /  |
    4---5---6
</pre>
Some bridges have not been used, so we retrace the tentative route until we reach checkpoint 3.
Then we lay out a new route from checkpoint 3 to 5 to 2 to 4 to 5 to 6 to 3.  Splicing this new
route back into the original route, we end up with the final race route: 0-1-3-5-2-4-5-6-3-2-0.

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
You will be given a <type>String[]</type> <b>bridges</b> that contains information about which checkpoints are
connected by bridges.  The i-th character of element j of <b>bridges</b> is '1' if there is a bridge between
checkpoints i and j.  Otherwise, it is '0'.  Note that both i and j are zero based.  All bridges are two-way so 
a bridge between checkpoints i and j appears in <b>bridges</b> in both directions, from i to j and from j to i.
You will return a <type>int[]</type> containing the sequence of checkpoints visited by the race route.

The initial tentative route is 0-1-2-3-0, which is then extended with 1-4-5-1 into 0-1-4-5-1-2-3-0.  Next, it is extended with 4-6-7-4 into 0-1-4-6-7-4-5-1-2-3-0.  Finally,

xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003e\nThe city of Konigsberg is famous for its bridges.  The Tour de Konigsberg\nis an annual bicycle race over a route that crosses each bridge exactly once.  \nYou are responsible for planning the route for this year's race.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003e\nA series of checkpoints numbered from 0 to N-1 have been set up around the city, with\nexactly one bridge between each pair of neighboring checkpoints.\nFor example, here is a picture of the bridges and checkpoints from last year's race.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003e\n    0-------1\n    |       |\n    |       |\n    |       |\n    2-------3\n    |\\     /|\n    | \\   / |\n    |  \\ /  |\n    4---5---6\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n(There has been substantial construction since last year, however, so the bridges and checkpoints for this year's race\nmay be completely different.)\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003e\nThe route for the race must begin and end at checkpoint 0, and must proceed across the bridges from checkpoint\nto checkpoint, crossing each bridge exactly once.  If the checkpoints are placed poorly, it might not be possible\nto come up with such a route, so the planner for the first Tour de Kongisberg, Leonhard Euler, was careful\nto leave instructions for how to lay out the checkpoints to guarantee that a successful race route will be possible.\nHe decreed that the checkpoints should be placed with an even number of bridges (greater than zero) leaving each checkpoint,\nand furthermore that every checkpoint must be reachable from checkpoint 0.  The checkpoints for this year's race\nwere placed with Euler's instructions in mind.  Now your task is to plan the race route.  Fortunately, Euler also\nleft notes telling you how.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003e\nYou begin by laying out a tentative route that begins and ends at checkpoint 0.  At every step\nalong the way, this initial route leaves the current checkpoint via the unused bridge that leads to the lowest\nnumbered checkpoint.  When the tentative route returns to checkpoint 0, it may or may not have used all the bridges.  If it has, you\nare done.  Otherwise, you need to extend the route to use more bridges as follows.  \nBeginning at checkpoint 0, you follow the tentative route until\nyou reach a checkpoint--call it checkpoint K--that has an unused bridge leading\nout from it.  (Note that K could be 0.)  Lay out a new route by starting at checkpoint K and \nrepeatedly taking the unused bridge that leads to the lowest numbered checkpoint until you return to checkpoint K.\nNow splice this new route into the tentative route after the first occurrence of K.\nRepeat this extension process on the new larger tentative route until all the bridges have been used.  Note that\nyou always restart the search for a checkpoint with an unused bridge back at the beginning of the tentative route; \nyou do \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e continue from where you left off.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003e\nFor example, in last year's race, the initial tentative route travelled from checkpoint 0 to 1 to 3 to 2.\nMarking the used bridges with x's we get\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003e\n    0-x-x-x-1\n    |       |\n    x       x\n    |       |\n    2-x-x-x-3\n    |\\     /|\n    | \\   / |\n    |  \\ /  |\n    4---5---6\n\u003c/pre\u003e\nSome bridges have not been used, so we retrace the tentative route until we reach checkpoint 3.\nThen we lay out a new route from checkpoint 3 to 5 to 2 to 4 to 5 to 6 to 3.  Splicing this new\nroute back into the original route, we end up with the final race route: 0-1-3-5-2-4-5-6-3-2-0.\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003e\nYou will be given a \u003ctype\u003eString[]\u003c/type\u003e \u003cb\u003ebridges\u003c/b\u003e that contains information about which checkpoints are\nconnected by bridges.  The i-th character of element j of \u003cb\u003ebridges\u003c/b\u003e is '1' if there is a bridge between\ncheckpoints i and j.  Otherwise, it is '0'.  Note that both i and j are zero based.  All bridges are two-way so \na bridge between checkpoints i and j appears in \u003cb\u003ebridges\u003c/b\u003e in both directions, from i to j and from j to i.\nYou will return a

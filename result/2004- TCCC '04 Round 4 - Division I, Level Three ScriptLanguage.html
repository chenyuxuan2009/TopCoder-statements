You are to write the part of a compiler that generates warning messages.
The programming language is a simple script language where
the only statements are assignments, IF-THEN-ELSE constructions and RETURN.
Variable names are limited to single upper case letters, and they're always
32-bit signed integers. Given a syntactically correct function written in this language,
generate the appropriate warning messages as described below.
</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
The syntax of the language only allows one statement per line.
Lines will not have leading or trailing spaces and tokens will be separated by exactly one space.
Formally, the syntax for each line is as follows:
</p>

<pre xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
&lt;line&gt;       :: &lt;head&gt; | &lt;assignment&gt; | &lt;if&gt; | ELSE | END IF | &lt;return&gt;
&lt;head&gt;       :: PARAM &lt;paramlist&gt; | PARAM
&lt;assignment&gt; :: &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;rvalue&gt;
&lt;if&gt;         :: IF &lt;variable&gt; &lt;relation&gt; &lt;value&gt; THEN
&lt;return&gt;     :: RETURN &lt;value&gt;
&lt;paramlist&gt;  :: &lt;variable&gt; | &lt;variable&gt; &lt;paramlist&gt;
&lt;rvalue&gt;     :: &lt;value&gt; | &lt;value&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;value&gt;
&lt;value&gt;      :: &lt;variable&gt; | &lt;integer&gt;
&lt;operator&gt;   :: + | - | * | /
&lt;relation&gt;   :: &lt; | = | &gt;
&lt;variable&gt;   :: A | B | ... | Z
&lt;integer&gt;    :: A 32-bit signed integer (without leading zeros)
</pre>
 
<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
The first line in the function will always be the function head (PARAM, optionally followed
by a space separated list of variables) and the last line will always
contain a RETURN statement. No other line may contain a function head,
although RETURN statements can occur elsewhere as well.
</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
Furthermore, each IF-statement has a corresponding END IF-statement and
an optional ELSE-statement in between. The IF-statements
may be nested, but then they will always be properly nested.
An IF-statement will always compare a variable with an integer or
a <i>different</i> variable.
</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
You should generate two different warnings, where appropriate.
These are: (quotes for clarity only)
</p>

<pre xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
"Line &lt;line&gt;: unreachable code"
"Line &lt;line&gt;: variable &lt;variable&gt; might not have been initialized"
</pre>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
The first warning should be given on lines which are never executed,
no matter how the IF-statements are evaluated. Each such line will
only receive this warning, and no other warnings. Lines containing
ELSE and END IF statements will never receive this warning (these lines
don't render into executable code by the compiler), see example 4.
</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
The second warning should be given on lines where the value of a variable is used,
but that variable might not have been assigned a value yet. A variable will have
a value assigned to it if it's in the parameter list in the function head,
or once it's been assigned a value by an assignment statement.
</p> 

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
When determining which warnings to give, you should assume that all IF-statements
can evaluate to either true or false, no matter which instructions
have previously been executed, see example 2. Line numbers start from 1, which
will always be the function head.
</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">
The warnings should be sorted primarily by line number. If a line
contains several different variables that all might be uninitialized,
those warning messages should be sorted alphabetically by the variable name,
see example 0.
</p>

Create a class ScriptLanguage containing the method warnings
that takes a <type>String[]</type> <b>code</b>, a function in
the script language and returns a <type>String[]</type> containing the
warning messages in the format specified above.

<p>
If the IF-statement evaluates to false, C will not be initialized, hence the warning message on line 5.
Also note that even though T is uninitialized, E and F shouldn't be considered uninitialized on line 8 and 10, even though their values are unknown. Finally note that there should only be one warning mentioning variable G on line 9.

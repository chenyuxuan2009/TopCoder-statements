individual performs when compared to the rest of the population.  This is done, in part, to
correct for inherent differences in the level of difficulty of different tests, and to make
the score values more meaningful.  For instance, saying that someone has an IQ of 130 (where
the score is based upon 100 being "average") is more useful that simply saying that someone
correctly answered 25 out of 40 questions on "Joe's Intelligence Test".</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">Standardized scoring typically utilizes two common statistical tools:  mean and standard
deviation.  "Mean" is commonly called the average.  Mean is calculated by summing all scores, and
dividing by the total number of scores.</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">Standard deviation is calculated in a multi-step process.
<ul>
<li>First, let <i>m</i> = the mean.</li>
<li>Then, for each score, <i>x</i>, calculate the square of its deviation from the mean,
(<i>x</i> - <i>m</i>) ^ 2.</li>
<li>Sum the individual squares, and divide by the total number of scores.</li>
<li>Finally, take the square root of that result.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">Once these figures are calculated, a raw score can be converted to a standardized score
by determining how many standard deviations above or below the mean raw score is.  A point value
is then assigned to the mean and standard deviation.  For instance, some intelligence tests
have a mean score of 100 points, and a standard deviation of 15 points.</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">You have been assigned the task of writing a program that will calculate the standardized
score for an individual, given their raw score (number of questions correct).  Specifically,
it has been explained to you that 1000 points is the average score, and each standard deviation
is 300 points.  Thus, if an individual's raw score is 1.5 standard deviations above average, their
standardized score would be 1450 points.</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">The test in question has already been administered to a sufficiently large set of testers.
Unfortunately, the raw scores of each test individual have been lost.  However, a summary of the
results, namely the percentage of individuals who correctly answered each question, is still
available, and you have been told that this will suffice to determine the mean and standard
deviation of the original data set.  Since the set of testers was very large, you can assume that the percentage of people who got a question correct represents the probability of any given person correctly answering that question.</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">You are given a <type>double[]</type> <b>questions</b>, where each element of <b>questions</b>
indicates the percentage of individuals who correctly answered that question.  You are also given
an <type>int</type> <b>testScore</b> indicating the number of questions correctly answered by
a new test subject.  Using the scoring methodology explained above, you are to return a
<type>double</type> indicating the standardized score that should be awarded to this individual.

<p>1</p>
<p>Returns: 1000.0</p>
<p>This is a simple case, since the average score is 1, a raw score of 1 is a standardized score of 1000.</p></div></li><li><div><p>{0.5, 0.5, 0.5}</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Returns: 1519.6152422706632</p>
<p>Out of 8 test takers, 1 will get no questions correct, 3 will get 1 question correct, 3 will get 2 questions, and 1 will get all 3.  We calculate a mean of 1.5, and a standard deviation of Sqrt(3)/2 = 0.866025.

A score of 3 is 1.5 above the mean, which is 1.73205 * SD.  We can then calculate the standardized score.</p></div></li><li><div><p>{0.2, 0.3, 0.4}</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Returns: 1806.6323435772447</p>
<p>With harder questions, scores will tend to be lower (mean score is now 0.9), and a perfect score is weighted higher.</p></div></li><li><div><p>{0.2, 0.3, 0.4}</p>

<p>Returns: 654.3004241811809</p>
<p>Same questions as above, but notice here that because of the expected low scores, even getting no questions correct doesn't get too low of a standardized score.</p></div></li><li><div><p>{0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9}</p>

xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eMany types of standardized testing award each test taker a score that is based on how an\nindividual performs when compared to the rest of the population.  This is done, in part, to\ncorrect for inherent differences in the level of difficulty of different tests, and to make\nthe score values more meaningful.  For instance, saying that someone has an IQ of 130 (where\nthe score is based upon 100 being \"average\") is more useful that simply saying that someone\ncorrectly answered 25 out of 40 questions on \"Joe's Intelligence Test\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eStandardized scoring typically utilizes two common statistical tools:  mean and standard\ndeviation.  \"Mean\" is commonly called the average.  Mean is calculated by summing all scores, and\ndividing by the total number of scores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eStandard deviation is calculated in a multi-step process.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst, let \u003ci\u003em\u003c/i\u003e = the mean.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThen, for each score, \u003ci\u003ex\u003c/i\u003e, calculate the square of its deviation from the mean,\n(\u003ci\u003ex\u003c/i\u003e - \u003ci\u003em\u003c/i\u003e) ^ 2.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSum the individual squares, and divide by the total number of scores.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinally, take the square root of that result.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eOnce these figures are calculated, a raw score can be converted to a standardized score\nby determining how many standard deviations above or below the mean raw score is.  A point value\nis then assigned to the mean and standard deviation.  For instance, some intelligence tests\nhave a mean score of 100 points, and a standard deviation of 15 points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eYou have been assigned the task of writing a program that will calculate the standardized\nscore for an individual, given their raw score (number of questions correct).  Specifically,\nit has been explained to you that 1000 points is the average score, and each standard deviation\nis 300 points.  Thus, if an individual's raw score is 1.5 standard deviations above average, their\nstandardized score would be 1450 points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eThe test in question has already been administered to a sufficiently large set of testers.\nUnfortunately, the raw scores of each test individual have been lost.  However, a summary of the\nresults, namely the percentage of individuals who correctly answered each question, is still\navailable, and you have been told that this will suffice to determine the mean and standard\ndeviation of the original data set.  Since the set of testers was very large, you can assume that the percentage of people who got a question correct represents the probability of any given person correctly answering that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eYou are given a \u003ctype\u003edouble[]\u003c/type\u003e \u003cb\u003equestions\u003c/b\u003e, where each element of \u003cb\u003equestions\u003c/b\u003e\nindicates the percentage of individuals who correctly answered that question.  You are also given\nan \u003ctype\u003eint\u003c/type\u003e \u003cb\u003etestScore\u003c/b\u003e indicating the number of questions correctly answered by\na new test subject.  Using the scoring methodology explained above, you are to return a\n\u003ctype\u003edouble\u003c/type\u003e indicating the standardized score that should be awarded to this individual.\n\u003c/p\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"d:[\"$\",\"main\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"children\":[\"$\",\"a\",null,{\"href\":\"/\",\"children\":\"Statistics\"}]}],[\"$\",\"h2\",null,{\"children\":[\"Problem Statement for \\\"\",\"TestScores\",\"\\\"\"]}],[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"className\":\"__className_c9cbed\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"article\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h3\",null,{\"children\":\"Problem Statement\"}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$f\"}}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h3\",null,{\"children\":\"Definition\"}],[\"$\",\"dl\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"dt\",null,{\"children\":\"Class:\"}],[\"$\",\"dd\",null,{\"children\":[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"TestScores\"}}]}],[\"$\",\"dt\",null,{\"children\":\"Method:\"}],[\"$\",\"dd\",null,{\"children\":[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"weightedScore\"}}]}],[\"$\",\"dt\",null,{\"children\":\"Parameters:\"}],[\"$\",\"dd\",null,{\"children\":[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"double[], int\"}}]}],[\"$\",\"dt\",null,{\"children\":\"Returns:\"}],[\"$\",\"dd\",null,{\"children\":[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"double\"}}]}],[\"$\",\"dt\",null,{\"children\":\"Method signature:\"}],[\"$\",\"dd\",null,{\"children\":[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"double weightedScore(double[] questions, int testScore)\"}}]}],[\"$\",\"dt\",null,{\"children\":\"(be sure your method is public)\"}]]}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h3\",null,{\"children\":\"Notes\"}],[\"$\",\"ul\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"li\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"The return value must be within 1e-09 absolute or relative error of the correct answer.\"}],[\"$\",\"li\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"You may assume that percentages of correct responses for each question are based upon an indefinitely large set of test data.\"}],[\"$\",\"li\",\"2\",{\"children\":\"For those familiar with typical statistical terminology, note here that we are using a \\\"population standard deviation\\\", since it is assumed that we are dealing with a sufficiently large set of test data.\"}]]}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h3\",null,{\"children\":\"Constraints\"}],[\"$\",\"ul\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"li\",\"0\",{\"children\":[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"questions will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.\"}}]}],[\"$\",\"li\",\"1\",{\"children\":[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"Each element of questions will be between 0.001 and 0.999, inclusive.\"}}]}],[\"$\",\"li\",\"2\",{\"children\":[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"testScore will be between 0 and n, inclusive, where n is the number of questions.\"}}]}]]}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h3\",null,{\"children\":\"Examples\"}],[\"$\",\"ol\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"li\",\"0\",{\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"\u003cp\u003e{0.5, 0.5}\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e1\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eReturns: 1000.0\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a simple case, since the average score is 1, a raw score of 1 is a standardized score of 1000.\u003c/p\u003e\"}}]}],[\"$\",\"li\",\"1\",{\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"\u003cp\u003e{0.5, 0.5, 0.5}\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eReturns: 1519.6152422706632\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOut of 8 test takers, 1 will get no questions correct, 3 will get 1 question correct, 3 will get 2 questions, and 1 will get all 3.

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">For N-1 pairs of ingredients, she remembers the proportion in which the ingredients within each pair should be added to the cocktail. Fortunately, these N-1 proportions are sufficient to restore the recipe of the entire cocktail.</p>

<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">You are given a <type>String[]</type> <b>proportions</b> containing the N-1 proportions. Each element is formatted "#&amp;lt;a&amp;gt; and #&amp;lt;b&amp;gt; as &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;q&amp;gt;" (quotes for clarity), which means that the mass of ingredient &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; divided by the mass of ingredient &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; in the cocktail must be equal to &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;q&amp;gt; (all ingredients are 0-indexed). Return a <type>int[]</type> containing exactly N elements, where the i-th element is the mass of ingredient i, such that all the given proportions are satisfied and the total mass is as small as possible.

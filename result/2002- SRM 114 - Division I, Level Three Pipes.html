Water at a certain pressure is sent down through a single starting pipe at the top, and proceeds down through branching pipes as it goes deeper.  Each branch gets a fraction of the pressure from all of the pipes above it, using the following algorithm:</p>
<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">Given a parent pipe, calculate the horizontal distance to every branch below it.  The fraction of the water pressure that a branch receives from the parent pipe is inversely proportional to the distance between the branch and the parent.  So for example, if a parent pipe has 3 branches: the first one 1 unit away, the second one 3 units away, and the third one 4 units away, the first branch would have 3 times as much pressure as the second, and 4 times as much pressure as the third.  Mathematically, this works out so that the first branch would have 12/19 of the pressure, the second branch would have 4/19 of the pressure, and the third branch would have 3/19 of the pressure.  Thus the first branch has 3 times the pressure as the second branch (12/19 versus 4/19), and 4 times the pressure as the third branch (12/19 versus 3/19).</p>
<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">The total pressure in each branch will be the sum of the pressures from all of the above pipes, converted into a percentage and rounded down to the nearest percent less than or equal to the actual percent.  This can be done by multiplying the fractional pressures by 100 and rounding down.  Assuming that the starting pipe has a pressure of 1 (100%), return the pressure of the indicated pipe at the bottom of the system as a rounded down percentage.  Also, notice that all the percentages are rounded down after each intermediate step, not just the last one.</p>
<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">If there is a branch directly under the parent pipe, it receives all of the water pressure from that parent, and none of the other branches receive any.</p>
<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">The first argument will be a cross-section of the system of pipes in the form of a <type>String[]</type>.  Each element will contain only spaces and the pipe ('|') character, and each element will contain at least one pipe character.  For example, <tt>{" | "," ||","| |"}</tt> would represent the system:</p>
<pre xmlns="http://topcoder.com">" | "
" ||"
"| |"</pre>
<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">The first element represents the top row of the system, the second element represents the second row, and so forth.  The top row in this example is a single pipe, which branches into 2 pipes, 1 a distance of 1 away, and 1 directly below it.  These in turn both branch into 2 more pipes (they branch into the same pipes, not 2 pipes each).  The second argument will be the 0-based index of the bottom level pipe (0 being the left-most, n-1 being the rightmost, where n is the number of pipes on the bottom level) in question.</p>
<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com">Return the percentage of the original pressure in the indexed pipe.  For example, if the pipe receives no pressure (as is possible when there is a branch directly below a parent pipe), the method should return 0, or if the pipe has all of the original pressure, the method should return 100.</p>

xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eA system of pipes is set up going vertically into the ground.  Water at a certain pressure is sent down through a single starting pipe at the top, and proceeds down through branching pipes as it goes deeper.  Each branch gets a fraction of the pressure from all of the pipes above it, using the following algorithm:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eGiven a parent pipe, calculate the horizontal distance to every branch below it.  The fraction of the water pressure that a branch receives from the parent pipe is inversely proportional to the distance between the branch and the parent.  So for example, if a parent pipe has 3 branches: the first one 1 unit away, the second one 3 units away, and the third one 4 units away, the first branch would have 3 times as much pressure as the second, and 4 times as much pressure as the third.  Mathematically, this works out so that the first branch would have 12/19 of the pressure, the second branch would have 4/19 of the pressure, and the third branch would have 3/19 of the pressure.  Thus the first branch has 3 times the pressure as the second branch (12/19 versus 4/19), and 4 times the pressure as the third branch (12/19 versus 3/19).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eThe total pressure in each branch will be the sum of the pressures from all of the above pipes, converted into a percentage and rounded down to the nearest percent less than or equal to the actual percent.  This can be done by multiplying the fractional pressures by 100 and rounding down.  Assuming that the starting pipe has a pressure of 1 (100%), return the pressure of the indicated pipe at the bottom of the system as a rounded down percentage.  Also, notice that all the percentages are rounded down after each intermediate step, not just the last one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eIf there is a branch directly under the parent pipe, it receives all of the water pressure from that parent, and none of the other branches receive any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eThe first argument will be a cross-section of the system of pipes in the form of a \u003ctype\u003eString[]\u003c/type\u003e.  Each element will contain only spaces and the pipe ('|') character, and each element will contain at least one pipe character.  For example, \u003ctt\u003e{\" | \",\" ||\",\"| |\"}\u003c/tt\u003e would represent the system:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003e\" | \"\n\" ||\"\n\"| |\"\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eThe first element represents the top row of the system, the second element represents the second row, and so forth.  The top row in this example is a single pipe, which branches into 2 pipes, 1 a distance of 1 away, and 1 directly below it.  These in turn both branch into 2 more pipes (they branch into the same pipes, not 2 pipes each).  The second argument will be the 0-based index of the bottom level pipe (0 being the left-most, n-1 being the rightmost, where n is the number of pipes on the bottom level) in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://topcoder.com\"\u003eReturn the percentage of the original pressure in the indexed pipe.  For example, if the pipe receives no pressure (as is possible when there is a branch directly below a parent pipe), the method should return 0, or if the pipe has all of the original pressure, the method should return 100.\u003c/p\u003e\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:T703,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003cp\u003e{\" | \",\"|||\"}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturns: 0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAll of the pressure goes into the center branch.\n\n{\" | \",\"|||\"}\n1\n\nReturns: 100\n\nAll of the pressure goes into the center branch.\n\n{\"     |     \",\"  | |    | \"}\n1\n\nReturns: 63\nThe distances of the branches are 3, 1, and 4 respectively.

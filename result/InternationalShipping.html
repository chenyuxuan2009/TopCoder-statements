However, the service only allows international shipping of packages whose (length + girth) does not exceed <b xmlns="http://topcoder.com">thresholdSize</b> inches.  The length of a box is its longest side.  The girth is the distance around the box perpendicular to the length.  In other words, if the two non-length sides are called width and height, girth is defined as width + height + width + height.  If a box has two equal sides that are greater than the third side, or if a box has three equal sides, any of the multiple longest sides can be used as the length.
<p xmlns="http://topcoder.com"/>
Your boxes are given as a <type xmlns="http://topcoder.com">String[]</type>, <b xmlns="http://topcoder.com">dimensions</b>, where each element represents a single box formatted as "&lt;side&gt;x&lt;side&gt;x&lt;side&gt;" (quotes for clarity only).  Each &lt;side&gt; is a positive integer with no leading zeros.  All lengths are given in inches.  Return a <type xmlns="http://topcoder.com">int[]</type> containing the zero-based indices of all the boxes that can be shipped, sorted in ascending order.  If none of the boxes can be shipped, return an empty <type xmlns="http://topcoder.com">int[]</type>.</div></div><div><h3>Definition</h3><dl><dt>Class:</dt><dd><span>InternationalShipping</span></dd><dt>Method:</dt><dd><span>getShippable</span></dd><dt>Parameters:</dt><dd><span>String[], int</span></dd><dt>Returns:</dt><dd><span>int[]</span></dd><dt>Method signature:</dt><dd><span>int[] getShippable(String[] dimensions, int thresholdSize)</span></dd><dt>(be sure your method is public)</dt></dl></div><div><h3>Constraints</h3><ul><li><span>dimensions will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.</span></li><li><span>Each element of dimensions will be formatted as "<side>x<side>x<side>" (quotes for clarity only), where each <side> is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, with no leading zeros.

<p>Box 0 has a length of 10 and a girth of 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 18.  (10 + 18) is greater than 25, so the package cannot be shipped.  Box 1 has a length of 3 and a girth of 12.  (3 + 12) does not exceed 25, so this package can be shipped.  Box 2 has a length of 21 and a girth of 4.  (21 + 4) does not exceed 25, so this package can also be shipped.  Since boxes 1 and 2 are shippable, the return value is {1, 2}.</p></div></li><li><div><p>{"100x99x98", "99x98x100", "98x99x100", "99x100x98"}</p>
